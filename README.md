What is a Cross-chain Bridge?
A cross-chain bridge is a type of blockchain infrastructure designed to connect different blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets or data across them. It solves the communication barrier between isolated blockchains, allowing users to move digital assets or information from one chain to another. Cross-chain bridges are essential for blockchain interoperability, liquidity sharing, and improving asset efficiency across ecosystems.

How a Cross-chain Bridge Works
You can think of a cross-chain bridge as a "mover" that transports assets safely from one blockchain to another.
For example, suppose you hold one ETH (an Ethereum token) and want to use it in a project on BNB Chain (formerly BSC), such as investing or mining.
The process generally involves four steps:
Deposit Stage: You deposit your ETH into the bridge's Ethereum smart contract, which acts like a secure vault that locks your ETH.
Packaging Stage: The bridge detects the deposit and creates an equivalent token (e.g., ETH-BSC) on the BNB Chain. This token holds the same value but is only usable on BNB Chain.
Usage Stage: You can freely use the ETH-BSC token on BNB Chain, such as purchasing NFTs or participating in DeFi applications.
Redemption Stage: When you no longer need the ETH-BSC token, you can destroy it. The system will then unlock and return your original ETH from the Ethereum network.

Key Functions of Cross-chain Bridges
Cross-chain bridges offer several essential functions:
Asset Transfer: The primary function is to allow a token or asset to be "moved" from the original blockchain to the target chain, such as transferring ETH from Ethereum to BNB Chain.
Data Synchronization and Transmission: Beyond assets, bridges can also transmit data—such as account states, transaction history, and even messages—between chains to support data sharing.
Smart Contract Interaction: Some advanced bridges allow smart contracts on different chains to communicate. For example, a contract on Chain A can call functions on Chain B.
Cross-chain Communication: Bridges can trigger events or send signals across blockchains, supporting coordination between chains and the execution of cross-chain protocols.

Main Types of Cross-chain Bridges
Lock and Mint Bridge:The original chain's asset is locked, and an equivalent pegged token is minted on the target chain.Example: WBTC, which maps Bitcoin to Ethereum.
Burn and Release Bridge:The token on the target chain is burned, and the original asset is released on the source chain.Often used together with the Lock and Mint approach.
Relay Bridge:Relay nodes listen for events on one chain and transmit them to another.Does not necessarily require a trusted third party and can offer stronger security.
Validator-based Bridge:A group of trusted validators confirm and transmit cross-chain transactions.Offers high efficiency but comes with higher centralization risk.
Decentralized Bridge (Light Client + Zero-Knowledge):Utilizes light clients or zero-knowledge proofs for validation.Offers greater security and decentralization without relying on intermediaries.

Conclusion
Cross-chain bridges are the "highways" that connect different blockchains, enabling digital assets, data, and smart contract logic to move freely between them. As a foundational technology for blockchain interoperability and multi-chain collaboration, cross-chain bridges play a crucial role in the Web3 ecosystem. Despite current challenges in security and performance, ongoing technological advancements continue to enhance their significance and reliability.
